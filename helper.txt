This is a helper file that will help us understand the codebase of the project. This is being updated by Tanvi.

HOW TO RUN THE APP
1. Clone the master branch of the repository in your CLI by "git clone https://github.com/tanviroy/fshn.git"
2. Then enter "npm install" in the root directory (/fshn) and in the frontend directory (/fshn/frontend) to install all dependencies.
3. Open the entire project in an IDE (VSCode is great). Open a terminal and in the root directory (/fshn) run "npm start" to start the backend server at localhost:5000.
4. Open another terminal in the frontend directory (/frontend) and run "npm start" to start the React App which will be served at at localhost:3000.
